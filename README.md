# Breast Cancer XGBoost Classifier

This project implements a machine learning workflow to classify breast cancer diagnoses using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. It includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and feature analysis.

## Project Highlights
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- XGBoost classifier model
- Feature importance visualization
- Correlation matrix analysis
- Confusion matrix evaluation
- Discussion of ethical considerations and next steps for deployment
